        Visionary Farming? Visionary Farming is a complete farming solution for
        a farmer to track, analyze and simulate the complete farming lifecycle.
        Users can visualize either a scene of their farm or their own farm in 2D
        or 3D.They will be able to interact with the simulated farm and perform
        activities on the farm like in real world. The tool allows farmers to
        simulate the existing farm and forecast the yield of crops, soil quality
        or threats of bugs based on factors like fertilisers, water cycle,
        pesticide and weather. Another add on product of the visionary farm will
        be a self-driving drone that can move in the farm on its own and keep
        track of what is happening real-time with the help of various cameras
        and sensors.
